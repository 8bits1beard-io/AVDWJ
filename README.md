# Virtual Date Adventure Game

A retro-styled "choose your own adventure" web game where players go on a virtual first date with Joshua. Experience different dating scenarios through multiple branching paths and see how well you connect based on your choices.

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum compatibility. Features a nostalgic '80s/'90s aesthetic with four different date scenarios: karaoke, retro arcade, stargazing, and restaurant dining.
